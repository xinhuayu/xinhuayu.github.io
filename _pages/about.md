## What's New

This is a test page for setting up personal pages on github (most other links are not working).

More to come about my research and my thoughts after I find (or make) a good template.

I have shared some codes for a few recent projects. You may access them directly through the papers.
   
   
## About me:

My name is Xinhua Yu. Here are a few things I would like to share with you:

- **My expertises**: Epidemiology and big data analytics (mostly structured tabular data).
- **My math specialty**: Probability and statistics,  and some stochastic processes.
- **My favorite hobby topics**: Number theory (more about history, but not about advanced topics) and (classic) geometry (sorry, never learned differential geometry or above). 
- **My favorite readings**: Ancient history around the world, currently, Hittites, Scythia and aborigins in western China (recent genetic studies showed they might be there long before people believed).
- **My best exercise**: Learn new programming language to keep my brain active (currently, data analysis with python). 
- **Things most puzzling me**: Western European scholars were making astronomical scientific discoveries since the 1600s, while China was stuck in the dark age, and almost nobody in China knew calculus even in the mid 1800s.
- **People admired most**: Beethoven, THE pianist who was almost deaf,  Euler, THE mathematician who was blind, and Hawking, THE physicist who was paralyzed.
